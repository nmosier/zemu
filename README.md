## Introduction
### What is the Z-machine? 
The [Z-machine][1] is a virtual machine developed by Infocom for their text-based adventure games.
One of their most-well known (and first) games is [Zork][2].
An interpreter program is required to play any of their games (generally distributed as .DAT files).

### What is special about ZEMU?
While many interpreters have been written for the major OSes,
ZEMU is the first interpreter for any TI-83/84 calculator.

### So What?
You can _finally_ play Zork on your TI-84+ CE.
