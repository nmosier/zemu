Z-Pages:
 * appvars must be less than 256^2 bytes
 * zork is 92K
 * need to be able to experiment with different page sizes -- this should be
   easily configurable at compile time.

Should make it so zemu need not be recompiled for different block sizes.


zmap format:
* header
* zpage table
  * zpapge table entry:
    * appvar name
    * start address
    * flags:
      * whether currently in RAM
      * perhaps some LRU info?

Environment variables:
ZPAGE_SIZE: default zpage size, used in all C programs, scripts, and assembly
