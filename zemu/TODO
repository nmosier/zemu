Features
[ ] Debug flag to build different debug vs. user targets


Optimizations
[ ] zaddr_fetch -- remember how much is left on page
[ ] cp_hl_de -- use "scf \ ccf \ sbc hl,de \ push af \ add hl,de \ pop af"
[ ] Never need to upcast in binary operations, since result is always stored as a word in memory.
[ ] Unary operations use de, not hl, as parameter.
[ ] Use system CP_HL_DE_S

    [ ] zcode_readop_force
